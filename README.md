Task 🧟‍♂️💻

Step 1: Download the dataset from the link available above. 

Step 2: Perform proper analysis of the dataset and draw conclusions based on your analysis.

Step 3: Build a Machine Learning Model to predict output based on the input column.

Step 4: **Bonus (max weightage) Make sure to apply:

Proper outlier detection and treatment.

Feature Engineering

Hyperparameter Tuning

Step 5: Use appropriate evaluation metrics and compare all the models and write your observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?
